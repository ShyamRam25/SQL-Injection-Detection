Using Non-Standard Techniques to Approach the Detection of SQL Injection Attacks


Abstract—The recent growth of backend related information technology has led to the rise of various SQL injection attack tools, often causing problems in the field of network security. Methods to detect and predict SQL injection attacks with Machine Learning using feature extraction and language processing contain inefficiencies that we plan to address using our novel approach. It is important to address these issues effectively because attacks can exploit vulnerabilities and potentially give attackers unauthorized access to sensitive information. This paper, along with our included video, proposes the use of TF-IDF combined with n-grams to capture the unique components and sequential structure of SQL payloads. The experimental results show that our model has a higher accuracy, precision, recall rate, and F-1 score compared to other models trained on the dataset—validating our effectiveness in detecting malicious payloads.
